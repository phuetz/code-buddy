2. **Bugbot** - GitHub-integrated debugging assistant
3. **Agent mode** - True end-to-end feature implementation
4. **Cursor Rules** - Project-specific AI behavior control
5. **VS Code compatibility** - Seamless migration
6. **Enterprise adoption** - Coinbase, major tech companies
7. **Multi-agent interface** - Parallel agent workflows

---

## 2025 Updates

### November 2025 (v2.0)
- Composer: First proprietary coding model
- Multi-agent interface for parallel workflows

### March 2025
- Auto-fix errors
- Navbar enhancements
